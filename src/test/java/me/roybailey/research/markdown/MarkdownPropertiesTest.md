# MarkdownProperties Test Samples

### Create a record (use variable name `create-record` to access the following code)
By the way, we can have other stuff in here to aid documentation.
* like a list
* and stuff
```CREATE bla bla bla```

> ___just remember to keep the code blocks to pairs___

### Read a record (```read-record```)
```READ bla WHERE bla.id = {id}```

### Update a record (`update-record`)
```
UPDATE bla
SET bla
WHERE bla.id = {id}
```

### Delete a record (`delete-record`)
```
DELETE bla
WHERE bla.id = {id}
```

### Simple properties file look-a-like
`simple`=`roger that`
`server.name`=`mighty.mike.com`

### Table based
| 1 | `first`  | `anna`   | first property
| 2 | `second` | `george` | second property
| 3 | `third`  | `sally`  | third property value
